# Bongo-Beats-Tap-With-Me-V2-Public-

This is the repository containing the code for the game *Bongo Beats: Tap With Me*, an inclusive cooperative multiplayer rhythm game with accessibility features for the visually impaired. This game was developed as part of my Master's Thesis study "*Improving the Player Experience of Collaborative Multiplayer Games for Visually Impaired Children*".

The game is designed to be played with two players, one holding an Xbox controller, and one using the HTC Vive controllers (for audio-haptics mode) or the HTC Vive Headset (for audio-visuals mode). For more information on the design please refer to my Master's Thesis Study.

## A Note on the Music of the Game
The songs used in the game are all royalty-free songs. They have not been included in the repository however, but in the folder "Assets->Audio->Music" you can find an excel sheet detailing where to download each song from. These songs should also be stored in that folder.
